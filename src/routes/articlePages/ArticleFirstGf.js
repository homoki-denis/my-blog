            It was a strange year for me. I start programming again and even
            finish college. It was really tough, but in the end it was rewarding
            nonetheless. Well I fell in love with a girl. ðŸ˜±

            I know, I know. I wont be speaking in this article much about
            programming. ðŸ˜‚ But I think I can say a few things about what I have
            learned. Well with work and more work, you need rest. I mean, I
            worked hard but at times I felt really weak. I can't even have the
            power to code anymore. I was just a slave to programming. Well, I
            met this girl at my college I was at. And she taught me, how to
            love, care, be there for someone and how to be a best friend. I
            mean, what could i ask for right? Well, when I really feel
            exhausted, and wanted to take a day off, I just message her and
            spend the day with her. It's really nice.
