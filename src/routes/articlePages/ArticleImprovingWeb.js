          As i said in the last article, I took a break from programming and
          came back a year later with high hopes and determination. ðŸ˜Ž And then
          start learning on my own. It was fun, I was on my own pace and nobody
          was rushing me to do anything. But this technique has a problem.
          People, i did not interact with anybody. I was alone, of course, I
          learn but with who i can compare my code to? With who I can discuss my
          problems? Well this is a different story and I will tell you about it
          in the next article. Now, how I started improving the web? Well, I
          started looking for solutions to the problems. Let's say an app that
          helps people, or makes it eazy for people to do tasks, like my{" "}
          <a href="/">todo app</a>.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="h5" gutterBottom component="div">
          Well i started learning code with some of the free sources out there,
          like:
          <ul className="list">
            <li>
              <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3School</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">FreeCodeCamp</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="https://www.sololearn.com/">Sololearn</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </Typography>
        <img
          src="https://media.giphy.com/media/QuIxFwQo0RMT1tASlV/giphy.gif"
          alt=""
          className="gif"
        />
        <Typography variant="h5" gutterBottom component="div">
          Then I kept learning and learning, and then boom. ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ Tutorial
          hell. ðŸ˜­ I was doing tutorial after tutorial but with no success on
          creating my app on my own. Then I started looking at a tutorial, let's
          say a todo app, then after I watch it, I code it without looking. Well
          it was hard, but manageable. In the end i have a grasp of what I
          should do and I should think when i'm developing an app.
